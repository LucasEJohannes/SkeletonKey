# SkeletonKey

Skeleton Key is a tool for guitarists to use to quickly see all the notes of a certain scale in a certain key.
It is used to visualize where the notes are on the neck of a guitar.

One difficulty I had during this project was embedding it all into an HTML file so the user can pick from a dropdown of scales and keys instead of having to type them in manually. I could not figure out a way to easily make it so the page would refresh with a new diagram after every new input, as my knowledge of sending information from a python script to HTML file is limited. I learned some basic knowledge of Flask and PHP, and with some more time and understanding of the systems, making it all compatible and fluid in an HTML page is the next step for this project.
